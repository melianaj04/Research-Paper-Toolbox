<h1>Internet Resources</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Some Resources to Consider</h2>
    <p>If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some resources that are available online include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Public domain writings</li>
        <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
        <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, if you can avoid making a trip to the library, you can save yourself time when researching.</p>

    <h2>Using Web Resources for Research</h2>
    <p>Some web resources can help you find additional resources, such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles are cited by other articles.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Books:</strong> Allows you to view a preview of a book, or in some cases, the entire book, including the references section.</li>
        <li><strong>Web of Science:</strong> Similar to Google Scholar, but for scientific papers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
    <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. Collections such as these offer you a wealth of resources and represent a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic, which can help you determine how your own topic relates to that research.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h2>
    <p>Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to question some of the arguments in a central article in her paper, "<em>The Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America</em>" by R.J. Connors (1982). She wants to see if other researchers have included atypical examples of technical writing instruction in their papers about the rise of Technical Communication as a discipline before World War II. Thinking that most articles written on this topic will have referenced Connors' article, she types the title into Google Scholar. She notices that Connors' article has been cited 62 times. From there, she searches the articles that cite Connors' article for the examples she is looking for.</p>

    <h2>That's It!</h2>
    <p>Hopefully you learned a little bit about conducting research and obtaining resources. Remember, if you start researching early enough, you are not limited to only those resources that you can find online. Now that you have read these suggestions for researching, please take a short quiz to help you retain some key points from this lesson.</p>
