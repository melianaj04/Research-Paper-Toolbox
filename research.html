    <h1>Realistic Research: University, Web-based, and Local Resources</h1>
    <p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program who want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, this lesson is designed to give students strategies to help them research more efficiently.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>After you read the above sections, you will be directed to a short quiz which will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
    <p>If you are a newly admitted student and have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the <a href="https://hawkcard.iit.edu">Hawk Card Homepage</a>. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
    
    <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started.</p>

    <h4>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h4>
    <p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in and clicking on that link.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="research2.jpg" alt="Library Services icon">
        <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>
    <p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>

    <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
    <h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
    <p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Let's unpack some of those terms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan?</li>
        <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article?</li>
        <li><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project:</strong> Do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project?</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is left before you must turn in your project?</li>
    </ul>

    <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.</p>
    </aside>

    <h4>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h4>
    <p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course...</p>

    <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
    <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine...</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="research4_image1.jpg" alt="Get Article Link Example">
        <figcaption>For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Requesting a Book From Another Library</h3>
    <p>When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library system...</p>

    <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember any of the titles you look up. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or on your flash drive.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
    <p>There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources...</p>

    <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break. When in doubt, call first.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>Internet Resources</h2>
    <h3>Some resources to consider</h3>
    <p>If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some resources that are available online include...</p>

    <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic.</p>
    </aside>

    <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
    <p>Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to question some of the arguments in a central article in her paper...</p>

    <p><em>That's it!</em> Hopefully, you learned a little bit about conducting research and obtaining resources.</p>
